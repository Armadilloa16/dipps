A collection of tools for reading and performing simple analyses of, Bruker
format peaklist data. See the included documentation for more detail.

This is a work in progress, and by no means a finished product. 
Use it with extreme skeptisism --- as you should use any 
software, and do any analysis --- skeptisism is the 
lifeblood of a scientist, embrace it.

If you wish to use this package, you should use the R package `devtools` to 
install it. If you don't have `devtools`, you can install it with:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once you have `devtools`, you can install this package with 

```
devtools::install_github("Armadilloa16/dipps")
```

after which you will be able to load and attach it in the normal way, with

``` 
library(dipps)
```

If you need a tutorial on how the functions provided are used, I'm working on 
a adapting a vignette and tutorial from that that is currently sitting in 
`Armadilloa16/dippsR`.
