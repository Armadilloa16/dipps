It seemed appropriate to use a full dataset as a worked example in order to 
write a vignette, but including a full MSI dataset in the `dipps` package seems
inappropriate, as it would be large and would cause installing the package to be
slow. As such I have written a vignette seperately, which can be accessed at 
https://github.com/Armadilloa16/dipps-vignette.
